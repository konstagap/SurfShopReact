## About
This is single page application (SPA) built with modern React.
Pages has great polish UI built with Bootstrap, and styled with CSS.
In order to style individual component I have used "Styled Components" library.
In this SPA we utilize modals. Our routing is implemented with "react-router-dom".
App built with functional components, state controled with React hooks and in order to skip props drilling we use React context API which is really easy to use in combo wtih useContext hook.
Data persistence relays on local storage in your browser, so dont worry if you close the page, your items will stay in the cart no matter what.
